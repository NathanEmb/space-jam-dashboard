# Space Jammers Dashboard

Web dashboard for the Space Jam fantasy basketball league. It is currently hosted at https://space-jammers.com!

## About

This project provides a dashboard for a fantasy basketball league (Space Jammers) that pulls data from ESPN's Fantasy API and displays various statistics and insights. The dashboard includes:

- Team statistics and category rankings
- Player performance metrics across different timeframes (7, 15, 30 days)
- Head-to-head matchup comparisons
- AI-generated witty commentary (using Groq's LLM API)

## Architecture

The application is built using:

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the web frontend
- [ESPN API](https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api) for fetching fantasy basketball data
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation and analysis
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for data visualization
- [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) for HTML template rendering
- [Groq API](https://groq.com/) for generating AI content

The project is containerized with Docker and deployed to AWS.

## Project Structure

- `src/backend.py` - Core logic for data fetching and processing
- `src/prompts.py` - Prompting for AI-generated content via Groq
- `src/frontend/` - Streamlit pages and UI components
  - `Spacejam_Dashboard.py` - Main dashboard entry point
  - `figures.py` - Matplotlib visualization functions
  - `streamlit_utils.py` - Utility functions for Streamlit UI
  - `pages/` - Additional views (Team Viewer, Matchup Viewer)
  - `components/` - Reusable UI components with HTML templates

## Features

- **Category Rankings**: Visualize team performance across different statistical categories
